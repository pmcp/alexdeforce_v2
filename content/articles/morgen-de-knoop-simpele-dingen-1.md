While it's drizzling on the black-and-white day. Morgen De Knoop embodies the poetry of getting stuck, the beauty of failure, the truth in the disconnect between what we want and what we can do. It's modern-day malaise at it's most elegant. Morgen De Knoop is burger service and Alex Deforce thriving between kleinkunst and new wave.
